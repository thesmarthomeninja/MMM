June 1, 2017  Credit Goes To: Jessica Langford  Machine Learning, Optimization, R, Statistics
Understanding the ROI across all of your paid marketing channels is a top priority for senior-level executives across every industry and every geographical market.  Getting a clear sense of the ROI on each channel allows companies to answer really important questions.  For example:

What will happen if I increase my Email spend by 20%?
What is the level of saturation I can expect from my Paid Search channel?
How do I incorporate seasonality into my budget allocation strategy?
How do I optimize my budget allocation across all of my paid channels?
Which geographies should I focus my efforts?
These are consequential questions that have the potential to have a major impact on how a business operates.  With that, itâ€™s no wonder that companies devote significant time, energy , and resources to creating (or purchasing) a Marketing (or Media) Mix Modeling framework.  The aim of this post is to show you how you can use the data that you already have in conjunction with open source tools to create your own MMM solution.
